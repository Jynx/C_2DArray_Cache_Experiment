For ALL cache simulations, use a capacity of 32768 bytes for both 
the I-cache and the D-cache.

cache1D
-------

Describe how you tested your code to verify that it works. 

  After allocating memory and checking to make sure it was allocated correctly,I implemented a check via an if statement to make sure that each index of the array had the correct contents of -3 for each iteration of the various loops. 

What do you get from running pin with a block size of 4 bytes?

  Instruction cache misses: 6351
  Instruction cache references: 16177994
  Data cache misses:    2016440
  Data cache references:    12091311

What is the hit ratio for the I-cache with a block size of 4 bytes?

  99.96%

What is the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 4 bytes?

  83.32%

What do you get from running pin with a block size of 32 bytes?

  Instruction cache misses: 1233
  Instruction cache references: 16177994
  Data cache misses:    260942
  Data cache references:    12091311

What is the hit ratio for the I-cache with a block size of 32 bytes?

  99.99%

What is the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 32 bytes?

  97.84%

What do you get from running pin with a block size of 64 bytes?

  Instruction cache misses: 732
  Instruction cache references: 16177994
  Data cache misses:    142425
  Data cache references:    12091311

What is the hit ratio for the I-cache with a block size of 64 bytes?

  .9999557 or 
  ~100%

What is the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 64 bytes?

  98.82%

Which block size is best for the I-cache?  Why?

  The best blocksize for the I-cache is the 64 byte block because it results in
  the highest hit ratio. However, the difference between 4 bytes to 64 bytes is much 
  more minimal than the differences seen in the D-cache between the block-sizes.

Which block size is best for the D-cache?  Why? In what way does the block 
size affect the hit ratio for this program? 

  The best blocksize for the D-cache is also the 64 byte block-size. It results in the 
  highest hit ratio. The higher block size allows for a higher number of memory locations 
  to be stored on the cache.

Comparison of cache2Drows and cache2Dcols
-----------------------------------------

Compare the performance (hit ratios) of the I-cache for these 2 programs.
Justify your statistics.

  The performance for the I-cache for both programs is very similar. The 
  instructions for each program are identical, so this makes perfect sense. Its
  only in the d-cache that things will differ with any significance. 

Compare the performance (hit ratios) of the D-cache for these 2 programs.
Explain any differences.

  In one instance, the cache has to reference to each beginning (whereever that
  may be) of each array before accessing the index of THAT array. In one implmentation
  (the 2Dcols) the cache is jumping back and forth between arrays, where as in the other, it's going through one at a time.
